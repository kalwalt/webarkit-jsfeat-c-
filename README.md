# webarkit-jsfeat-cpp
c++ [jsfeat](https://github.com/inspirit/jsfeat) version to build a WASM version thanks to Emscripten.
The project is a Work in Progress, not all the features are implemented to make a comparison with the original jsfeat code. 
At the moment only a raw matrix_t class is implemented and a bunch of imgproc.grayscale's functions are under testing. Anyway the main idea is to provide c++ code to build a WASM version, it's not intended to be used as a c++ library.
## Examples
Take a look at our examples in the examples folder:

- matrix_test.html
- grayscale_example.html
